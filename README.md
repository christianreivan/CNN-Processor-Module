# CNN-Processor-Module

## INTRO
This project is addressed to design an Eyeris-based AI processor module. Operation uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) concept with the illustration as following:

Operation is done between 2x2 filter matrix and 2x2 input matrix as shown in the figure below:

## Checklists

- Designed simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) operation for Eyeris-based AI processor module with pipelining and folding architecture
- Translated block diagrams into RTL codes.
- Created design was behaviorally simulated in Quartus and Modelsim.

## ALERT
Should you intend to use all the RTL codes, please do not forget to cite the author as:

    -- This project was originally created by Christian Reivan, Bandung Institute of Technology.   
    -- Created from October to November 2021.
