## Checklists

- Designed simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) operation for Eyeris-based AI processor module with pipelining and folding architecture
- Translated block diagrams into RTL codes.
- Created design was behaviorally simulated in Quartus and Modelsim.

## ALERT
Should you intend to use all the RTL codes, please do not forget to cite the author as:
